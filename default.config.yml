# For RSA keys, the minimum size is 1024 bits and the default is 4096 bits. Generally, 2048 bits is considered sufficient.
# DSA keys must be exactly 1024 bits as specified by FIPS 186-2.
# For ECDSA keys, size determines the key length by selecting from one of three elliptic curve sizes: 256, 384 or 521 bits.
# Attempting to use bit lengths other than these three values for ECDSA keys will cause this module to fail.
# Ed25519 keys have a fixed length and the size will be ignored.
