## How to report a bug

Report bugs on the [Issue Tracker].

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these questions:

- Which operating system and Python version are you using?
- Which version of this project are you using?
- What did you do?
- What did you expect to see?
- What did you see instead?

The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a test case,
and/or steps to reproduce the issue.

## How to set up your development environment

You need Python 3.11+ and the following tools:

- [Molecule]
- [Podman]
- [Pre-commit]
- [Vagrant] (optional)

The good thing is to install them you just need [Ansible] and this playbook.

[Pre-commit] is installed with `python_developer` tools, [Podman] and [Vagrant] with [Nix] packages by default. For [Molecule] just add it to your `pip_packages`:

```sh
pip_packages:
  - name: molecule
```

[molecule]: https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/molecule/en/latest/
[podman]: https://podman.io/
[pre-commit]: https://pre-commit.com/
[vagrant]: https://www.vagrantup.com/

## How to test the project

Run the tests locally:

```sh
molecule test
```

Tests are located in the `Molecule` directory and are executed in `Podman` containers.

### Using Vagrant

To provision this playbook in a VM use our `Vagrantfile` using VirtualBox or modify the file to use Libvirt.

The VM is created and provisioned with:

```sh
vagrant up
```

The default password for root in the VM is `vagrant`.

## How to submit changes

Open a [pull request] to submit changes to this project.

Your pull request needs to meet the following guidelines for acceptance:

- Pre-commit hooks need to pass.
- Include tests when relevant. This project maintains a high code coverage.
- If your changes add functionality, update the documentation accordingly.

Feel free to submit early, thoughâ€”we can always iterate on this.

To run linting and code formatting checks before commiting your change, you can install pre-commit as a Git hook by running the following command:

```sh
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
```

It is recommended to open an issue before starting work on anything.
This will allow a chance to talk it over with the owners and validate your approach.
